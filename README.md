# CPU Scheduler - FCFS Algorithm
The CPU Scheduling Visualizer is a that tool visualizes the First-Come, First-Served (FCFS) CPU scheduling algorithm, helping users understand how process scheduling works in operating systems.

## Features
1. Process Input: Users can input processes with details such as arrival time and burst time.
2. Process Queue: Displays the list of processes as they arrive, showing their order in the queue.
3. Gantt Chart: Visual representation of the process execution order and duration on a timeline.
4. Process Details: Detailed information for each process, including waiting time, turnaround time, and relaxation time.
5. Statistics: Displays average waiting time, turnaround time, and relaxation time for all processes.
   

## Usage
1. Select the FCFS Algorithm: The algorithm is pre-selected as FCFS.
2. Add Processes: Enter the arrival time and burst time for each process. The process will be added to the queue.
3. View Process Queue: The list of processes will be displayed, showing the order of execution.
4. View Gantt Chart: A Gantt chart will be generated, visually representing the process execution over time.
5. Process Details: Detailed stats for each process will be shown, including waiting time, turnaround time, and relaxation time.
6. Statistics: The final section provides the average waiting time, turnaround time, and relaxation time across all processes.


## Tech Stack
1. React.js: The application is built using React.js, a powerful JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React's component-based architecture makes it easy to manage the state of the application and render dynamic content.
2. Tailwind CSS: Tailwind CSS is used for styling the application. This utility-first CSS framework allows for quick and efficient design with minimal custom CSS.
